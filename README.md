# meteor-mouse-display

A little wrapping display for mouse movement in an attractive meteor style. Could be useful for game/design streaming Built using bevy. 
Features mouse tracking without the window needing to be in focus. 
Used to be transparent but windows updated something that broke transparency. Waiting for bevy or winit to fix.

```sh
# Compile with cargo:
cargo run --bin main
```
